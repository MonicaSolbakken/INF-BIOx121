Remember every time you log into cod3 on a terminal
source /data/vc/exerDefinitions/setupEnv.bash # to ensure that you have set a few useful variables defining file paths
/data/vc/exerDefinitions/copyFiles.bash # to make sure you have all the latest versions of files copied to your home directory

# Note: if you do not complete an exercise, you should get in touch with me or one of the assistants
# You will need to copy the pre-computed results to the relevant directory in your home area
# The commands will look something like the following for the 020_basicPipeline (you can figure out the command for 030_advancedPipeline):
rsync -au --progress /data/vc/exerResults/020_basicPipeline ~/vc/exerSandbox/q

# Today we will need to copy quite a few files from our exercises back to our local machines to be able to visualise them in IGV
# We will use rsync to do this from a terminal ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE
# -a ensures you retain the timestamps on the receiver
# -u ensures you only transfer files that have changed on the sender
# --progress ensures you get a report on progress
rsync -au --progress yourUsername@cod3.hpc.uio.no:~/vc/exerSandbox/02_basicPipeline dirOnYourLocalMachine

rsync -au --progress yourUsername@cod3.hpc.uio.no:~/vc/exerSandbox/03_advancedPipeline dirOnYourLocalMachine

## Fix for last exercise

You get an error in this command
java -Xmx2G -jar ${swDir}/GenomeAnalysisTK-3.2-2/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T VariantAnnotator \
-R $refFile \
--variant $vcfNSFP \
--resource:exac ${dataDir}/exac/ExAC.r0.3.sites.vep.chr5.vcf.gz \
--expression exac.AF \
-o ${vcfNSFP%.*}.exac.vcf

Skip ahead to this command:
bcftools view -O b ${vcfNSFP%.*}.exac.vcf > ${vcfNSFP%.*}.exac.bcf
and change it to:
    bcftools view -O b ${vcfNSFP%.*}.vcf > ${vcfNSFP%.*}.bcf
    AND change all following commands accordingly

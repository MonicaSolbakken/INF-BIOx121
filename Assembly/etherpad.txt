Assembly day 1

If you run out of disk space on the local PC, you'll need to delete files from last week. Guest accounts only have 5Gb space.

Assembly module material: http://inf-biox121.readthedocs.org/en/2015/Assembly/

Day 1 after lunch: start at http://inf-biox121.readthedocs.org/en/2015/Assembly/practicals/02_Assembly_using_velvet.html
Run assemblies on the cod3 server


Go to www.govote.at and use the code 14 30 58

To make the terminal prompt show which server you are on, type
export PS1="[\u@\h \W]\$ "

Will Trimble on palindromic kmers: "Even-k kmers come in two classes--those that are palindromic and those that are not. Odd kmers are never palindromic--all kmers and their reverse compliments are distinct--so you never worry about double-counting them or forgetting to double count them.So it's a convenience to limit your attention to kmers that can't collide with their reverse complements."

From cod3, check what you are running on cod4:
    


ssh username@cod4.hpc.uio.no "top -b -n 1 -u username"

Get last line of file

tail assembly.out

Follow output while it is being written (updating 'live')

tail -f assembly.out
t

Assembly day 2
Run this command to set up your environment again:
    
export PATH=/data/bin/:$PATH


Overnight assemblies
Run the assemblathon_stats script on your assembly
One person of each group makes a copy of this google spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_BWpW6dFkgqj3UOiMFXDsVXayec6C6CXFiFGuFisUQ/edit?usp=sharing
Fill in the details of the assemblies

Precomputed assemblies are here: /data/assembly/precomputed
Don't copy everything, just the finished fasta (check the instuctions)

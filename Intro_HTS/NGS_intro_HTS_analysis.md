# Day 1

## Sequencing technologies

### What sequencing platforms do you know
Exercise using Mentimeter wordcloud

Special types

* 10X genomics
* Dovetail Genomics
* Moleculo/TruSeq synthetic reads
* BioNano Genomics


### Read lengths versus throughput for sequencing instruments
Exercise using Google sheets:

* for each sequencing instrument still being sold, find the specifications on the company website
* make a plot in a google spreadsheet with the read length on the x-axis and the per-run throughput in Gigabp on the Y axis
* make both axis log scale
* my example is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BluwxeEfAK2QEIprPdzJK_Nsmqlkl9Xue5zQmBSCi44/edit#gid=0)

Discuss my version on figshare: <http://figshare.com/articles/developments_in_NGS/100940>. See also [my blog post](https://flxlexblog.wordpress.com/2016/07/08/developments-in-high-throughput-sequencing-july-2016-edition/) on the most recent edition.

Illumina [has a poster](http://www.illumina.com/applications/sequencing/ngs-library-prep/library-prep-methods.html) with all library preparation methods. 

Lior Pachter has "an up-to-date annotated bibliography of *Seq assays (functional genomics assays based on high-througphput sequencing)" on [this page](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/seq/).

Slide with figure 4 from [Reuter *et al* 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.05.004).

### Selected applications

* RNA-seq
* Assembly and metagenomics
* ChIP-seq
* Amplicon sequencing
* SNP typing and discovery
* Single-cell sequencing

Early finish at 14:00

### OPTIONAL: Q&A session on genomics/genetics/biology

For those students not well versed in biological subjects

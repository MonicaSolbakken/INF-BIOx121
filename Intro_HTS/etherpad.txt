Exercise:
for each sequencing instrument still being sold, find the specifications on the company’s website
make a plot in a google spreadsheet with the read length on the x-axis and the per-run throughput in Gigabp on the Y axis
make both axis log scale
Decide for yourself what to take as length and throughput – but be able to defend your choices

Questions for the sequencing experts
Why is high/low GC a problem for Illumina sequencing?
Why is high/low GC less of a problem for PacBio sequencing?

Day 2
Skills needed for analysing HTS data
http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/becoming-a-data-scientist/

http://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/courses/other/Carpentry/index.html


Access to the course server:
https://login.tl.uio.no with your UiO username and password
Open a terminal and type 'hostname' to find out your server ID, it has the form ibv-course0#.hpc.uio.no

OR
ssh -X username@ibv-course0#.hpc.uio.no where # is the number you see when you type 

MAC users: if you get a 'LC_CTYPE' like warning, it looks like you can ignore it.

Please install Anaconda on your laptop before Monday (better: before Friday)
https://www.continuum.io/ 
Choose 'Download Anaconda'
Choose Python 3.5 version GRAPHICAL INSTALLER

Then see if you can start a Jupyter notebook, either from the 'Launcher' coming with Anaconda, or by opening a terminal window and typing

jupyter notebook

Article regarding reliability of variant calling (Ensembl vs RefSeq transcripts DB, plus ANNOVAR vs VEP)  http://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gm543 

Article regarding reliability of variant calling http://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gm543 

Please write down what you think may be the problem (if any) with these real datasets in /data/qc

ChipSeq_example.fastq:
Base calling looks strange because of common regions (index?), early in sequence
GT repreating/alternating base sequence repeats
sequence pattern at the beginning on most of the reads could be explain by common binding site
GC content deviating from expected
GT repeat at the start
low GC content 

microRNA_example.fastq:
microRNAs are shorter than the sequence length, hence the bad quality towards the end of the reads
tile problem at position 19
high duplicate level because we're looking at transcriptome 
Adapters are not removed, causing duplcates
Probable PCR artifact 
conservative k mer at the beginning
repetition due most  likely to a transcript being overly expressed against others

more_cod_read1.fastq & more_cod_read2.fastq:
Two of the tiles in the more_cod_read2.fastq were not read
Looks like lane-specific problems in more_cod_read1.fastq
low quality at the end of reads in  more_cod_read2.fastq probably cos repetitive elements showed in overrepresented sequences

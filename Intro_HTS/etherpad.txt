On Windows, in the applications menu, look for the IFI-Linux.xw32 program and launch that; this should log you in to a linux machine

If you get a warning about your home area not being mounted, you'll need a guest account, we'll get those for you.

Once you are logged in, please fill out our pre-course questionnaire so we can  get an impression on the background of the students:  http://goo.gl/forms/aiXtGJtZPO

Introduction to HTS and data analysis

Exercise: Read lengths versus throughput

* for each sequencing instrument still being sold, find the specifications on the companyâ€™s website
* make a plot in a google spreadsheet with the read length on the x-axis and the per-run throughput in Gigabp on the Y axis
* make both axis log scale
